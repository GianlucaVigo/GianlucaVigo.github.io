## New feature
This [exam](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse/tree/22-09-05) is requesting the definition of the **random operator and randomize statement**.

## How does the feature work?

### Random Operator

The **random** operator generates a new random number from the last one returned (denoted by _n_) by using the formula below: 

>  **(1664525 x _n_ + 1013904223) mod (2)^32**

The formula above is called _Linear Congruential Generator_ and the initial value of _n_ is set to 12345.

**NB**

Since all integers in ACSE are 32-bit in size, there's no need to explicitly compute the modulo operator.

### Randomize Statement

The **randomize** statement resets _n_ to the value of the expression enclosed between the parenthesis of the statement.

---
## Code example
```c
int a, i;

i = 0;
while (i < 3){
  write(random()); // 87628868, 71072467, -1962130922
  i = i + 1;
}

randomize(12300 + 45);
write(random()); // writes 87628868
a = random() / 1000 + 7;
write(a); // writes 71072467 / 1000 + 7 = 71079
```

## Resolution
**scanner.l**

I need to include the random operator and randomize statement new tokens RANDOM, RANDOMIZE, so that they can be recognized. 

```c
"random"                       { return RANDOM; }
"randomize"                    { return RANDOMIZE; }
```

whenever in a program the scanner sees "random" or "randomize", it returns respectively RANDOM and RANDOMIZE.

**parser.y**

In the parser file there will be the majority of the work.

1) global variable declaration

```c
t_regID random_n;
```
The _random\_n_ variable is holding the seed for the random operator. It is initialized with 12345.

2) token declaration

```c
%token RANDOM RANDOMIZE
```

3) random_n initialization

```c
program
  : var_declarations 
  {
    printf("------ random-n initialization ------\n");
    random_n = getNewRegister(program);
    genLI(program, random_n, 12345);
  }
  statements EOF_TOK
  {
    // Generate the epilog of the program, that is, a call to the
    // `exit' syscall.
    genEpilog(program);
    // Return from yyparse().
    YYACCEPT;
  }
;
```

I modified the program expansion rule so that after the variable declarations, I define a new register to be assigned to the global one and, in conclusion, I load in it the constant "12345".

4) Add the **randomize** statement in the list of statements

```c
statement
  : assign_statement SEMI
  | if_statement
  | while_statement
  | do_while_statement SEMI
  | return_statement SEMI
  | read_statement SEMI
  | write_statement SEMI

  | randomize_statement SEMI

  | SEMI
;
```

5) Implement the randomize_statement functionality

```c
randomize_statement
  : RANDOMIZE LPAR exp RPAR
  {
    printf("------ randomize statement ------\n");
    genADD(program, random_n, $3, REG_0);
    printf("random_n is set to the specified expression\n");
  }
;
```

I restore the original value of the _random\_n_ global variable.

6) Implement the random operator by expanding the "exp" rule

```c
exp
  : NUMBER
.
.
  | RANDOM LPAR RPAR
  {
    printf("-------- Random operator --------\n");

    //-----------
    $$ = getNewRegister(program);

    genMULI(program, $$, random_n, 1664525);
    genADDI(program, $$, $$, 1013904223);

    genADD(program, random_n, $$, REG_0);
    //-----------
    
    printf("random_n has changed!\n");
  }
;
```

I take _random\_n_ and I multiply it by 1664525, then I add 1013904223 to this intermediate result: this will be the number returned by the operator through $$ register.

The same number is then stored into random_n variable.


## Testing

1) run the command `make all` in order to let the compiler be aware about the new features/modifications

2) added the [tests/random/random.c](#code-example) file

3) run the command `./bin/acse ./tests/random/random.c -o ./tests/random/random.asm` to translate c code into assembly

![220905_asm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acab3289-f147-4e2e-90a0-774260394427)

4) run the command `./bin/asrv32im ./tests/random/random.asm -o ./tests/random/random.o` to translate assembly file into an object one

5) run the command `./bin/simrv32im ./tests/random/random.o` to run the object file

6) see the results

## NB

* there's no explicit method that gives the possibility to store a value of a register into an other one, so that's why when we need to store in the result register ($$) the value contained in, for instance, register 5 ($5), we perform an ADDI/ADD operation in which one addend is 0/REG_0 and the second one $5.

> `$$ = $5 + REG_0 (or 0)`

* here's an image to show how the register naming works:

![220905_asm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c550574a-f929-46f8-a911-e5d55cf26520)

* labels require first the **creation**

> `LABELNAME = createLabel(program)`

 then the **assignment**

> `assignLabel(program, LABELNAME)`
