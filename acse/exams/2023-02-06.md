# 2023-02-06 FLC Lab exam: modified assignment statement

## New feature
This [exam](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse/tree/23-02-06) is requesting the definition of the **modified assignment statement**

## How does the feature work?
In the unmodified _Lance_ language, assignments can only specify one variable on the left side of the '=' token, and one expression on the right-hand side of the '=' token.
In addition to this syntax, comma-separated lists of variables and comma-separated lists of expressions shall be allowed to appear on the left and right sides of the '=' token respectively.

NB:
* The length os the two lists must be the same, otherwise SYNTAX ERROR.
* The list on the left-hand side should NOT include array elements, otherwise SYNTAX ERROR.
* The order of variables in the list matches the order of expressions: the first expression is assigned to the first first variable and so on.
* The order in which the assignments are made in the compiled code is unspecified.

## Code example

Correct execution (**multassign.c**)

```c
int d, a, b, c, e, f, g;
d = 34;
a, b, c = 10, 23, 41;
e, f, g = a*2, 16/4, b*c;

// Simple assignment
write(d); // 34

// Multiple assignment
write(a); // 10
write(b); // 23
write(c); // 41

// Multiple assignment (complex case)
write(e); // 20
write(f); // 4
write(g); // 943
```
---

Execution with errors (**multassignERR.c**):

```c
// More vars than exprs
int a, b, c;

a, b, c = 10, 13;


// More exprs than vars
/*
int a, b, c;
c = 10;
a, b = 12, 13, 14;
*/


// Array case
/*
int a[2], b;

a[1] = 4;
b, a[0] = 1, 2;

write(a[0]);
write(a[1]);
write(b);
*/
```

where:

1) MORE VARS THAN EXPRS case -> syntax error!

2) MORE EXPRS THAN VARS case -> syntax error!

3) ARRAY case -> syntax error!


## General Idea

I can implement the multiple assignment in the following way:

- I keep **only one** list which is storing the variables by appending them.
- the expressions are organized sintactically in a list and are managed immediately and singularly (**so there's no need of storing also the expressions**)
- the actual expression is assigned to the head/first variable in the list then I remove the head of the variable list. I iterate this procedure until a correct or erroneous outcome.


## Resolution
**scanner.l**

In the _scanner.l_ file, I don't need to add new tokens since the '= (ASSIGN)' is already defined.


***

**parser.y**

In the parser file there will be the majority of the work.

1) defined a global variable to hold the variable list

```c
// multiple assignment lists
t_listNode *varListNode = NULL;
```


2) Expand the scalar assignment only (the array one has been left unchanged)

```c
/* An assignment statement stores the value of an expression in the memory
 * location of a given scalar variable or array element. */
assign_statement
  : var_list ASSIGN exp_list // SCALAR assignment (modified)
  {
    printf("\n-----------------------------------------------------\n");

    if(listLength(varListNode) > 0){
      yyerror("Number of variables is greater than the number of provided expressions");
      YYERROR;
    }
  }
  | var_id LSQUARE exp RSQUARE ASSIGN exp // ARRAY assignment (unchanged)
  {
    genStoreRegisterToArrayElement(program, $1, $3, $6);
  }
;
```

The multiple assignment statement requires a variable list, an assign (=) token and an expression list.

When the code in the { } is executed, the multiple assignment should have been already performed: so I check the ERROR CASE nr 1 (MORE VARS THAN EXPRS) by leveraging on the `listLenght(list)` function presented below.

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3957aae9-e1f9-4cf4-9906-82f58bd98495)

If the lenght is **greater than zero**, it means that there are some left variables in the list not assigned yet and this shouldn't happen.

---

```c
var_list
  : var_list COMMA single_var
  | single_var
;

single_var
  : var_id {

    // if an array -> error
    if (isArray($1)){
      yyerror("Can't have an array on the left hand part of a multiple assignment");
      YYERROR;
    }

    varListNode = listInsert(varListNode, $1, -1);
  }
;
```

The variable list is a list of comma-separated variables (MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENT) or even a single one (SINGLE ASSIGNMENT).

The _single\_var_ token is referring to a variable that shouldn't be an array, so I check for ERROR CASE nr 3 (ARRAY) by using the `isArray()` function shown below.

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cbef984-87d7-44a5-9422-a9c52729cceb)

If the check is passed, I append (`pos = -1` at the end of the list) in the varListNode list the scalar variable by means of the `listInsert(list, data, pos)` list method below reported.

**NB**: the variable is passed _BY REFERENCE_ and the pointer is of type _VOID_ (this means that when we'll need to use it again, we have first to cast it to its original type which is **t_symbol** as shown below).

---

```c
exp_list
  : exp_list COMMA single_exp
  | single_exp
;

single_exp
  : exp {
    printf("\nexp START\n");

    if(listLength(varListNode) == 0){ // varListNode is empty = zero length list
      yyerror("Number of expressions is greater than the number of variables provided");
      YYERROR;
    }

    printf("\tvar list lenght BEFORE: ");
    printf("%d\n", listLength(varListNode));

    printf("\t\tCurrent head is: ");
    printf("%s\n", ((t_symbol *)varListNode->data)->ID);

    t_symbol *var_to_assign = ((t_symbol *)varListNode->data);

    genStoreRegisterToVariable(program, var_to_assign, $1);

    printf("\t\t\t..Assignment completed..\n");

    varListNode = listRemoveNode(varListNode, varListNode);
    printf("\t\tHead var removed\n");

    printf("\tvar list lenght AFTER: ");
    printf("%d\n", listLength(varListNode));

    printf("exp END\n");
  }
;
```

The expression list is a list of comma-separated expressions (MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENT) or even a single one (SINGLE ASSIGNMENT).

The _single\_exp_ token is referring to an expression.

First I check the ERROR CASE nr 2 (MORE EXPRS THAN VARS) by checking the length of the variable list by using the `listLength(list)` function, presented below.

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05b1fd92-0abd-47f0-8897-69e5ca3a8a92)

If the lenght is **equal to zero**, it means that there are no more variables to be assigned with a value: so I have more expressions than variables.

There's some debug code that con be usefull for a better explanation.

Through the `t_symbol *var_to_assign = ((t_symbol *)varListNode->data);` instruction, I'm considering the head node **data** portion of the variable list and I'm casting it to be of type _t_symbol_ so now `var_to_assign` can be treated as a variable.

Through the `genStoreRegisterToVariable(program, var_to_assign, $1);` instruction, I'm actually assigning the current `single_exp` to `var_to_assign`.

When the assignment is completed... through the `varListNode = listRemoveNode(varListNode, varListNode);` I delete the head node of the var list (our `var_to_assign` seen so far!)

Consider the t_symbol struct:
