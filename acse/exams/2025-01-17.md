# 2025-01-17 FLC Lab exam: Ternary operator

## New feature
This [exam](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse/tree/25-01-17) is requesting the definition of the **ternary operator**

## How does the feature work?
The ternary operator has the following syntax:

>  **exp1 ? exp2 : exp3**

in which:
* _exp1_: condition to evaluate
* _exp2_: value returned if the condition is TRUE
* _exp3_: value returned if the condition is FALSE

Moreover:
* lowest priority of all operators
* left-associative

## Code example
`int a;`

`a = 10;`

`a = (a > 5 ? 5 : 15) + 3;`

`write(a==8 ? 1 : 0) // prints 1`

## Resolution
**scanner.l**

I need to include the ternary operator new tokens: in particular the question mark (?) and the colon (:), so that they can be recognized.

`"?"                       { return QUESTION; }`

`":"                       { return COLON; }`

whenever in a program the scanner sees ? or :, it returns QUESTION and COLON respectively.

**parser.y**

In the parser file there will be the majority of the work.

1. token declaration

`%token QUESTION COLON`

2. associativity and precedence

**`%left QUESTION COLON`**

`%left OROR`

`%left ANDAND`

`%left OR_OP`

`%left XOR_OP`

`%left AND_OP`

`%left EQ NOTEQ`

`%left LT GT LTEQ GTEQ`

`%left SHL_OP SHR_OP`

`%left PLUS MINUS`

`%left MUL_OP DIV_OP MOD_OP`

`%right NOT_OP`

where 'left' is indicating the associativity and the 'rank/position' instead the precedence: so the lowest (going top-down: from lowest to highest).

3. Since the ternary operator is indeed an operator, not a new statement to add, we need to expand the **exp** clause.

`exp`

`: NUMBER`

`...`

`| exp QUESTION exp COLON exp` _//the structure of the ternary operator_

`{`

`$$ = getNewRegister(program);` _//the operator value that will be returned must be stored always in the $$ register_

_//label creation:_

`t_label *Else = createLabel(program);` _//one for the ELSE part_

` t_label *End = createLabel(program);` _//one for the END of the program_

_//check the value of the first exp: 0(false) -jump-> Else label, 1(true) -> next instr._

_//$1 register holds the exp1 value_

_//REG_0 is a special register containing 0 (zero)_

`genBEQ(program, $1, REG_0, Else);`

_//TRUE case: exp2 will be returned_

_//$3 register holds the exp2 value_

`genADDI(program, $$, $3, 0);`

`genJ(program, End);` _//the value in $$ is the correct one so I can jump at the end of the program_

_//FALSE case (after the :)_

`assignLabel(program, Else);`

_//$5 register holds the exp3 value_

`genADDI(program, $$, $5, 0);` _//exp3 will be returned_

`assignLabel(program, End);` _//end of the program_

`}`

## Testing

1) run the command `make all` in order to let the compiler be aware about the new features/modifications

2) added the [tests/ternary/ternary.c](#code-example) file

3) run the command `./bin/acse ./tests/ternary/ternary.c -o ./tests/ternary/ternary.asm` to translate c code into assembly

4) run the command `./bin/asrv32im ./tests/ternary/ternary.asm -o ./tests/ternary/ternary.o` to translate assembly file into an object one

5) run the command `./bin/simrv32im ./tests/ternary/ternary.o` to run the object file

6) see the results

## NB

* there's no explicit method that gives the possibility to store a value of a register into an other one, so that's why when we need to store in the result register ($$) the value contained in, for instance, register 5 ($5), we perform an ADDI/ADD operation in which one addend is 0/REG_0 and the second one $5.

> `$$ = $5 + REG_0 (or 0)`

* here's an image to show how the register naming works:

* labels require first the **creation**

> `LABELNAME = createLabel(program)`

 then the **assignment**

> `assignLabel(program, LABELNAME)`
