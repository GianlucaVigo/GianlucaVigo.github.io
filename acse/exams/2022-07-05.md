# 2022-07-05 FLC Lab exam: count\_ones operator

## New feature
This [exam](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse/tree/22-07-05) is requesting the definition of the **count\_ones operator**

## How does the feature work?
The count\_ones operator takes an **arbitrary expression** as its only argument. The value of the operator is the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of the value of the expression.

>  **count_ones(_expr_)**

Moreover:
* _Lance_ language only supports 32-bit sized integers, the maximum result of _count\_ones_ must be 32.

---
## Code example
```c
int a, b;
a = 123456;

b = count_ones(a) + 100;
write(b); // b = 106

b = count_ones(a - 64 + 255);
write(b); // b = 13

b = count_ones(-1);
write(b); // b = 32

write(count_ones(-16));
write(count_ones(19));
```

The variable _a_ is initialized with the value 123456, whose binary representation is 11110001001000000 has 6 digits set to 1.

In the first assignment, the variable _b_ is assigned with the value of an expression containing _count\_ones_. The value of _count\_ones_ is 6, as its argument is simply the value of _a_. The rest of the expression adds 100 to this value so, in the end, _b_ is assigned the value 106.

In the second assignment, the value of _count\_ones_ is 13, as the binary representation of the value of the expression "a - 64 + 255" is 11110001011111111 which contains 13 _one_ digits.

Finally, in the third assignment, the value -1 is represented in binary by 32 _one_'s because of the two's complement notation. As a result, the _count\_ones_ is 32.

Binary representation of -16: 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0000 -> 28 digits set to '1'

Binary representation of 19: 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0011 -> 3 digits set to '1'

## Resolution
**scanner.l**

I need to include the count\_ones operator new token COUNT\_ONES, so that it can be recognized. 

```c
"count_ones"              { return COUNT_ONES; }
```

whenever in a program the scanner sees "count_ones", it returns COUNT_ONES.

**parser.y**

In the parser file there will be the majority of the work.

1) token declaration

```c
%token COUNT_ONES
```

2) Since the count\_ones operator is indeed an operator, not a new statement to add, we need to expand the **exp** clause.

```c
exp
  : NUMBER
.
.
  | COUNT_ONES LPAR exp RPAR
  {
    // result register declaration 
    $$ = getNewRegister(program);

    // labels creation:
    // - start of the loop/cycle
    t_label *loop = createLabel(program);
    // - end of the program
    t_label *end = createLabel(program);

    // registers definition:
    // how many bits I have to shift
    t_regID offset = getNewRegister(program);
    genLI(program, offset, 31);
    // single bit obtained by ANDI operation
    t_regID singleBit = getNewRegister(program);
    // shifted version of exp
    t_regID numShifted = getNewRegister(program);


    // LOOP STARTS
    assignLabel(program, loop);

    // numShifted is $3 value shifted to the right by offset times
    genSRA(program, numShifted, $3, offset);
    // singleBit = num && 1 (returns the least significant bit)
    genANDI(program, singleBit, numShifted, 1);
    // update the result by adding singleBit
    genADD(program, $$, $$, singleBit);
    // if (offset == 0) -j-> "end"
    genBEQ(program, offset, REG_0, end);
    // otherwise ->  update offset
    genSUBI(program, offset, offset, 1);

    // -> "loop"
    genJ(program, loop);
    // LOOP ENDS

    // END
    assignLabel(program, end);
 }
;
```

## Testing

1) run the command `make all` in order to let the compiler be aware about the new features/modifications

2) added the [tests/countones/countones.c](#code-example) file

3) run the command `./bin/acse ./tests/countones/countones.c -o ./tests/countones/countones.asm` to translate c code into assembly

4) run the command `./bin/asrv32im ./tests/countones/countones.asm -o ./tests/countones/countones.o` to translate assembly file into an object one

5) run the command `./bin/simrv32im ./tests/countones/countones.o` to run the object file

6) see the results

## NB

* there's no explicit method that gives the possibility to store a value of a register into an other one, so that's why when we need to store in the result register ($$) the value contained in, for instance, register 5 ($5), we perform an ADDI/ADD operation in which one addend is 0/REG_0 and the second one $5.

> `$$ = $5 + REG_0 (or 0)`

* here's an image to show how the register naming works:

* labels require first the **creation**

> `LABELNAME = createLabel(program)`

 then the **assignment**

> `assignLabel(program, LABELNAME)`

* genSRA()
