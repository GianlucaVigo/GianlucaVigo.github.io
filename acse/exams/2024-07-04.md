# 2024-07-04 FLC Lab exam: Tri operator

## New feature
This [exam](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse/tree/24-07-04) is requesting the definition of the **tri operator**

## How does the feature work?
Triangular numbers are integers that count objects arranged in a triangle. The value of the n_th triangular number is defined by the following equation:

> **T(n) = [n(n+1)]/2**

Examples:
* T(1) = 1
* T(2) = 3
* T(3) = 6
* T(4) = 10
* T(5) = 15
* ...

The tri operator has the following syntax:

>  **tri(_exp_)**

in which:
* _exp_: index of the triangular number to compute 

Moreover:
* the **tri** operator is applicable to to negative numbers, but it always returns zero.
> T(n <= 0) = 0

## Code example
```c
int i = 0;

while (i < 10) {
  write(tri(i + 1)); // print T_1, T_2, ..., T_10 
  i = i + 1;
}
```

## Resolution
**scanner.l**

I need to include the **tri** operator new token: in particular the tri token, so that it can be recognized.

```c
"tri"                       { return TRI_OP; }
```

whenever in a program the scanner sees **tri**, it returns TRI_OP.

**parser.y**

In the parser file there will be the majority of the work.

1) token declaration

```c
%token TRI_OP
```
2) Since the TRI operator is indeed an operator, not a new statement to add, we need to expand the **exp** clause.

```c
exp
: NUMBER

...

| TRI_OP LPAR exp RPAR // the structure of the tri operator
{
  // the operator value that will be returned must be stored always in the $$ register
  $$ = getNewRegister(program);

  // initialize the result to return to zero
  genADDI(program, $$, REG_0, 0); 

  // label pointing to the end of the operator program
  t_label *l_End = createLabel(program);

  // jump to the l_End label, if exp <= zero
  genBLE(program, $3, REG_0, l_End);

  // new temporary register
  t_regID tmp = getNewRegister(program);

  //n = exp, tmp = n + 1
  genADDI(program, tmp, $3, 1);

  //Tn = n*(n+1)
  genMUL(program, $$, $3, tmp);

  //Tn = [n*(n+1)]/2
  genDIVI(program, $$, $$, 2);

  //end of the operator
  assignLabel(program, l_End);
}
```

## Testing

1) run the command `make all` in order to let the compiler be aware about the new features/modifications

2) added the [tests/tri/tri.c](#code-example) file

3) run the command `./bin/acse ./tests/tri/tri.c -o ./tests/tri/tri.asm` to translate c code into assembly

4) run the command `./bin/asrv32im ./tests/tri/tri.asm -o ./tests/tri/tri.o` to translate assembly file into an object one

5) run the command `./bin/simrv32im ./tests/tri/tri.o` to run the object file

6) see the results

## NB

* there's no explicit method that gives the possibility to store a value of a register into an other one, so that's why when we need to store in the result register ($$) the value contained in, for instance, register 5 ($5), we perform an ADDI/ADD operation in which one addend is 0/REG_0 and the second one $5.

> `$$ = $5 + REG_0 (or 0)`

* here's an image to show how the register naming works:

* labels require first the **creation**

> `LABELNAME = createLabel(program)`

 then the **assignment**

> `assignLabel(program, LABELNAME)`
