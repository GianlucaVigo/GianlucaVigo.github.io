# 2024-02-13 FLC Lab exam: pick operator

## New feature
This [exam](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse/tree/24-02-13) is requesting the definition of the **pick operator**

## How does the feature work?

The **pick** operator has the following syntax:

> **pick(_array_, _exp_)**

When it's computed, **pick** searches for the first bit set to 1 in the value of _exp_, scanning the bits starting from the least significant one. Then it reads the element in _array_ at the same index as the bit found, and it returns the value of the array element as the value of the operator.

Moreover:
* bit indices are considered starting from 0 for the least significant bit.
* if no bits are set to 1 or if the index of the bit exceeds the bounds of _array_, the value of the **pick** operator will return 0.
* the compiler shall produce a syntax error if _array_ is not a valid array identifier.

Example:
Consider the number 123456 and its binary representation shown below:

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c021704f-f71c-4e16-958d-7f508d5fa37f)

Scanning it from right to left: the first 1 we find is on bit 6. 

As a result, **pick** will read the array element at index 6 and return it.



## Code example

```c
int a[10], i, c;

i = 0;

while(i < 10) {
  a[i] = i+1;  // a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
  i = i+1;
}

// least significant bit set to 1 is bit 6
c = pick(a, 123456) * 1024; 

// prints a[6] * 1024 = 7168
write(c);

// least significant bit set to 1 is bit 10 -> out of bounds!
c = pick(a, c);

// prints 0
write(c);                     

// exp is equal to 0 -> prints 0
write(pick(a, c - 7168));     
```


## Resolution
**scanner.l**

I need to include the **pick** operator new token: in particular the pick token, so that it can be recognized.

```c
"pick"                    { return PICK; }
```

whenever in a program the scanner sees **pick**, it returns PICK.



**parser.y**

In the parser file there will be the majority of the work.

1. token declaration

```c
%token EOF_TOK  // End of file.
%token LPAR RPAR LSQUARE RSQUARE LBRACE RBRACE
%token COMMA SEMI PLUS MINUS MUL_OP DIV_OP MOD_OP
%token AND_OP XOR_OP OR_OP NOT_OP
%token ASSIGN LT GT SHL_OP SHR_OP EQ NOTEQ LTEQ GTEQ
%token ANDAND OROR
%token TYPE
%token RETURN
%token READ WRITE ELSE

%token PICK
```

2. Since the PICK operator is indeed an operator, not a new statement to add, we need to expand the **exp** clause.

```c
exp
: NUMBER

...

| PICK LPAR var_id COMMA exp RPAR
{
    // if not an array -> error
    if (!isArray($3)) {
      yyerror("First argument to pick must be an array");
      YYERROR;
    }

    // result initalization: 0
    $$ = getNewRegister(program);
    genADDI(program, $$, REG_0, 0);

    // end label creation: it refers to the end of the current operator program
    t_label *end = createLabel(program);

    // find the first 1 bit in the exp value
    t_regID tmpShifted = getNewRegister(program);
    t_regID tmpAnd = getNewRegister(program);

    // bitIndex: register stores the index of the  array
    t_regID bitIndex = getNewRegister(program);
    genADDI(program, bitIndex, REG_0, 0);

    // cycle labels declarations
    t_label *endLoop = createLabel(program);
    t_label *startLoop = createLabel(program);

    // array size
    t_regID arraySize = getNewRegister(program);
    genLI(program, arraySize, $3->arraySize);

    // integer size
    t_regID intSize = getNewRegister(program);
    genLI(program, intSize, 32);

    // CYCLE STARTS HERE
    assignLabel(program, startLoop);

    // condition register holds the comparison results
    t_regID condition = getNewRegister(program);

    // check the index wrt the array size: if greater **or equal** (NB: array index is zero-based) -> end (result = 0)
    genSGE(program, condition, bitIndex, arraySize);
    genBNE(program, condition, REG_0, end);

    // check the index wrt the integer size (= 32): if greater or equal -> end (result = 0)
    genSGE(program, condition, bitIndex, intSize);
    genBNE(program, condition, REG_0, end);

    // performs the main check: (exp >> bitIndex) & 1
    genSRA(program, tmpShifted, $5, bitIndex);
    genANDI(program, tmpAnd, tmpShifted, 1);

    // check the result of: (x >> n) & 1
    // TRUE case: got the first bit set to 1 and its position (bitIndex)
    genBNE(program, tmpAnd, REG_0 , endLoop);

    // FALSE case: got a bit set to 0, so I increase the position by 1 and I compute again the cycle
    genADDI(program, bitIndex, bitIndex, 1);
    genJ(program, startLoop);

    // CYCLE ENDS HERE
    assignLabel(program, endLoop);

    t_regID arrayElement = genLoadArrayElement(program, $3, bitIndex);
    genADD(program, $$, REG_0, arrayElement);
    assignLabel(program, end);
  }
;
```

## Testing

1) run the command `make all` in order to let the compiler be aware about the new features/modifications

2) added the [tests/pick/pick.c](#Code example) file

3) run the command `./bin/acse ./tests/pick/pick.c -o ./tests/pick/pick.asm` to translate c code into assembly

4) run the command `./bin/asrv32im ./tests/pick/pick.asm -o ./tests/pick/pick.o` to translate assembly file into an object one

5) run the command `./bin/simrv32im ./tests/pick/pick.o` to run the object file

6) see the results

## NB

* there's no explicit method that gives the possibility to store a value of a register into an other one, so that's why when we need to store in the result register ($$) the value contained in, for instance, register 5 ($5), we perform an ADDI/ADD operation in which one addend is 0/REG_0 and the second one $5.

> `$$ = $5 + REG_0 (or 0)`

* here's an image to show how the register naming works:

![240213-RegNum](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05b45e09-0592-4952-b536-fee3ede22dd3)

* here's an image to show how the n-th bit of _exp_ can be retrieved.

> * the green operation is a SHIFT TO RIGHT one
> * the blue operation is an AND with a single bit set to 1
> * in yellow the result of the check (when we find the first bit set to one, we can access the array at position specified by the green operation)

![240213-Check](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f871bc90-2dbc-46d9-81ea-f640e88a0fee)

* labels require first the **creation**

> `LABELNAME = createLabel(program)`

 then the **assignment**

> `assignLabel(program, LABELNAME)`

* scalar/array variable **DECLARATION** works in the following way:

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc37a867-aaac-4959-bf74-4c1ea86b9e13)

so that it is of type **t_symbol**.

whenever in the program there's a _var_id_, we retrieve a pointer to a **t_symbol** element

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f0cca19-38b7-4213-84d6-21762df82156)

... as in this situation ...

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eaec366-859a-45e0-9584-abd1a681981c)

 ... so that $3 (IDENTIFIER of a scalar/array variable) will be of type **t_symbol*** (pointer to t_symbol element) which has the following struct:

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25fec4f9-2ea3-48e8-91f1-ad20358554d5)

because of this, I can use the `isArray()` function, which is characterized by this syntax:

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2a75ba8-41d1-49ec-8bc7-60c244850f4f)

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93f6ded1-2b81-499c-a4a2-62dc315db73e)

Moreover, I can access to all the t_symbol fields through the dereference operator (->)

![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4d9092d-1782-4edd-a6a1-c241896326b2)

* when we're dealing with arrays, always refer to the following functions:

> * ARRAY (reference + index) -> REGISTER

> ![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77c8d7ca-f528-4d15-a5ab-00929c84d15d)

> * REGISTER/CONSTANT -> ARRAY (reference + index)

> ![immagine](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/443c8ba9-8cb5-41fa-9f84-b5bd571d97e2)

these enable the data motion between arrays and registers.
