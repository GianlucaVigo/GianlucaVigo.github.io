# 2024-06-13 FLC Lab exam: if-repeat-until statement

## New feature
This [exam](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse/tree/24-06-13) is requesting the definition of the **if-repeat-until statement**

## How does the feature work?
The **if-repeat-until** statement has the following syntax:

> **if_repeat** (_exp1_) _block_ **until** (_exp2_);

The **if-repeat-until** statement is a loop controlled by the two expressions _exp1_ and _exp2_:

- _exp1_: evaluated once before the loop 
  - if it's **FALSE** (equal to zero)
    - the loop is NOT executed
  - if it's **TRUE** (different than zero)
    - the _block_ is executed in a loop which stops when _exp2_ is evaluated to TRUE

NB:
* _exp1_ is evaluated only ONCE

## Code example
```c
int i;

read(i);

if_repeat (i < 3) { 
  write(i);
  i = i + 1;
} until (i == 6);

write(99);
```

***

First, an integer value is read from standard input and assigned to variable i. 

Then the if-repeat-until statement checks if i < 3. 

If that is not the case, the entire statement is skipped and execution continues at the "write(99);" line. 
> For instance, if the number inserted is 5, the program skips the loop and only prints 99.

If the i < 3 condition is met, the loop starts executing. At each iteration, the loop body prints i and it increments it.
The loop stops when i reaches 6, and then the program reaches the "write(99);" line.
> For instance, if the number inserted is 2, the program prints 2, 3, 4, 5, 99

## Resolution
**scanner.l**

I need to include the **if-repeat-until** statement new tokens: in particular the IF_REPEAT and UNTIL tokens, so that they can be recognized.

```c
"if_repeat"                   { return IF_REPEAT; }
"until"                       { return UNTIL; }
```

whenever in a program the scanner sees **if_repeat** and **until**, it returns respectively IF_REPEAT and UNTIL.

***

**parser.h**

I need to associate to the IF_REPEAT token a semantic value. 

This means that I'm associating to the IF_REPEAT token two informations:
* exit label
* loop label
that will always be necessary whenever a if-repeat-until statement is inserted in the code.

```c
typedef struct {
  t_label *exit;
  t_label *loop;
} t_ifRepeatStmt;
```

***

**parser.y**

In the parser file there will be the majority of the work.

1. union declaration

```c
%union {
  int integer;
  char *string;
  t_regID reg;
  t_symbol *var;
  t_listNode *list;
  t_label *label;
  t_ifStmt ifStmt;
  t_whileStmt whileStmt;

  t_ifRepeatStmt ifRepeatStmt;
}
```

through this declaration we can use "ifRepeatStmt" as an alternative of "t_ifRepeatStmt" in the code.

2. token declaration

```c
%token UNTIL
```
since the IF_REPEAT token has a semantic value, I specify it in an other section:

```
%token <ifStmt> IF
%token <whileStmt> WHILE
%token <label> DO
%token <string> IDENTIFIER
%token <integer> NUMBER

%token <ifRepeatStmt> IF_REPEAT
```

3. Insert the if-repeat-until statement in the **list of statements** available.

```c
statement
  : assign_statement SEMI
  | if_statement
  | while_statement
  | do_while_statement SEMI
  | return_statement SEMI
  | read_statement SEMI
  | write_statement SEMI

  | if_repeat_statement SEMI

  | SEMI
;
```
4. Since the if-repeat-until is a statement we need to inserted it from scratch.

```c
if_repeat_statement
  : IF_REPEAT LPAR exp RPAR { 
    // creation of the two labels
    // - one for the end of the program
    $1.exit = createLabel(program);`

    // - one for indicating the starting point of the loop
    $1.loop = createLabel(program);
    
    // if exp1 (stored in ) is FALSE (= 0) the loop is NOT executed so -jump-> to end of the program

    // if exp1 is TRUE -> execute loops (go to next instruction)
    genBEQ(program, $3, REG_0, $1.exit);
    
    // starting point of each loop
    assignLabel(program, $1.loop);

  } code_block UNTIL LPAR exp RPAR {
    
    // executes the loop while exp2 is FALSE -jump-> loop label, when expr2 is TRUE the loop stops
    genBEQ(program, $9, REG_0, .loop);
    
    // end of the statement
    assignLabel(program, $1.exit);
  }
;
```

## Testing

1) run the command `make all` in order to let the compiler be aware about the new features/modifications

2) added the [tests/if-rep-until/if-rep.c](#code-example) file

3) run the command `./bin/acse ./tests/if-rep-until/if-rep.c -o ./tests/if-rep-until/if-rep.asm` to translate c code into assembly

4) run the command `./bin/asrv32im ./tests/if-rep-until/if-rep.asm -o ./tests/if-rep-until/if-rep.o` to translate assembly file into an object one

5) run the command `./bin/simrv32im ./tests/if-rep-until/if-rep.o` to run the object file

6) see the results

## NB

* there's no explicit method that gives the possibility to store a value of a register into an other one, so that's why when we need to store in the result register ($$) the value contained in, for instance, register 5 ($5), we perform an ADDI/ADD operation in which one addend is 0/REG_0 and the second one $5.

> `$$ = $5 + REG_0 (or 0)`

* here's an image to show how the register naming works:

* labels require first the **creation**

> `LABELNAME = createLabel(program)`

 then the **assignment**

> `assignLabel(program, LABELNAME)`
