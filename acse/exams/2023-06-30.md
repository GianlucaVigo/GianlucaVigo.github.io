# 2023-06-30 FLC Lab exam: software emulated division operator
## New feature
This [exam](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse/tree/23-06-30) is requesting the definition of the **software emulated division operator**

## How does the feature work?
The software-emulated division operator shall have the same functional behavior of regular division for positive dividend and divisors. No DIV instructions must be emitted by ACSE to translate it to assembly language.


The software-emulated division operator has the following syntax:

>  **_exp1_ [/] _exp2_**

in which:
* _exp1_: dividend
* _exp2_: divisor

Examples:
* 6 / 3 = 2   ==   6 [/] 3 = 2

Moreover:
* the operation may have undefined behavior if either or both dividend and divisor are negative (= the implementation does not need to handle that case).
* Division by zero must be handled by computing a quotient of 2^(31) - 1
* The code executed at compile time is not restricted in its use of division instructions.
* Its **precedence** and **associativity** are the same as non-emulated standard division, which is retained and coexists with the new software-emulated one.

TIP:
* the simplest algorithm for computing division is called _repeated substraction_. It involves subtracting the divisor from the dividend until the dividend becomes smaller than the divisor. The quotient is given by the number of substractions performed.

## Code example
```c
int a, b;

read(a);
read(b);

if (a / b == a [/] b) {
  write(1);
} else {
  write(0);
}
```

## Resolution
**scanner.l**

I need to include the **software-emulated division** operator new token: in particular the soft_div_op token, so that it can be recognized.

```c
"[/]"                     { return SOFT_DIV_OP; }
```

whenever in a program the scanner sees **[/]**, it returns SOFT_DIV_OP.

**parser.y**

In the parser file there will be the majority of the work.

1) token declaration

```c
%token SOFT_DIV_OP
```

2) Consider the associativity (LEFT) and precedence of the SOFT_DIV_OP: it's indeed the same with respect to traditional division and multiplication.

```c
%left OROR
%left ANDAND
%left OR_OP
%left XOR_OP
%left AND_OP
%left EQ NOTEQ
%left LT GT LTEQ GTEQ
%left SHL_OP SHR_OP
%left PLUS MINUS

%left MUL_OP DIV_OP SOFT_DIV_OP MOD_OP

%right NOT_OP
```

3) Since the SOFT_DIV operator is indeed an operator, not a new statement to add, we need to expand the **exp** clause.

```c
exp
  : NUMBER 
.
.
  | exp SOFT_DIV_OP exp
  {
    // REGISTERS
    // result initialization to zero
    $$ = getNewRegister(program);
    genADDI(program, $$, REG_0, 0);
    // reminder initialization to the dividend (stored in $1)
    t_regID reminder = getNewRegister(program);
    genADDI(program, reminder, $1, 0);
    // stores the check value
    t_regID condition = getNewRegister(program);

    // LABELS creation
    t_label *conditionLabel = createLabel(program); // where the loop starts
    t_label *exitLabel = createLabel(program); // where the program ends
    

    // while (reminder >= divisor)
    assignLabel(program, conditionLabel);

    // check if dividend (reminder) is greater or equal than divisor ($3)
    genSGE(program, condition, reminder, $3);
    // $1 >= $3 -> condition = 1 -> we can perform another substraction (increment by 1 the result)
    // $1 < $3  -> condition = 0 -> stop
    //
    // if (condition == 0) -jump-> exitLabel
    genBEQ(program, condition, REG_0, exitLabel);

    // if (condition == 1)
    // while body
    genADDI(program, $$, $$, 1); // increment the result by one
    genSUB(program, reminder, reminder, $3); // reminder = reminder - divisor
    genJ(program, conditionLabel);

    // end of the operator program code
    assignLabel(program, exitLabel);
  }
;
```

## Testing

1) run the command `make all` in order to let the compiler be aware about the new features/modifications

2) added the [tests/softdiv/softdiv.c](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse/wiki/2023%E2%80%9006%E2%80%9030-Exam-=-Software-Emulated-Division-operator#code-example) file

3) run the command `./bin/acse ./tests/softdiv/softdiv.c -o ./tests/softdiv/softdiv.asm` to translate c code into assembly

4) run the command `./bin/asrv32im ./tests/softdiv/softdiv.asm -o ./tests/softdiv/softdiv.o` to translate assembly file into an object one

5) run the command `./bin/simrv32im ./tests/softdiv/softdiv.o` to run the object file

6) see the results

## NB

* there's no explicit method that gives the possibility to store a value of a register into an other one, so that's why when we need to store in the result register ($$) the value contained in, for instance, register 5 ($5), we perform an ADDI/ADD operation in which one addend is 0/REG_0 and the second one $5.

> `$$ = $5 + REG_0 (or 0)`

* here's an image to show how the register naming works:

* labels require first the **creation**

> `LABELNAME = createLabel(program)`

 then the **assignment**

> `assignLabel(program, LABELNAME)`
