# Wireless Internet Polimi Course Project: Characterizing MAC Randomization

**_@MAC @polimi @polimi-wi @polimi-projects @MAC-randomization @wireless-internet_**

## Project Description
Modern smartphones randomize their MAC address during probe request emission. 
You are requested to produce a dataset characterizing the MAC randomization of your own device, following what done in the following paper: “A dataset of labelled device Wi-Fi probe requests for MAC address de-randomization” by L. Pintor and L. Aztori, Computer Networks, Vol. 205, March 2022. 
The project should output a set of .pcap files, containing probe requests emitted from your smartphones in different conditions (screen on/off, Wi-Fi on/off, Power saving on/off) to characterize the randomization behaviour of your smartphone. 
A final report is required to describe your findings.

## Project Components
The project is characterized by three main elements:
- **PDF Report**: it contains every aspect of the project implementation, from the Setup to the Results.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: it is the notebook, I designed for filtering and analysis operations.
- **Wireshrak Captures Folder**: it contains all the captures used as sources (both in .pcap and .pcapng versions)

## GitHub Repo
