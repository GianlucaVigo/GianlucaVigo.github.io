# Welcome to my personal site
Here are presented all the projects I'm working or I worked on.

## acse (WIP)
This [project](https://gianlucavigo.github.io/acse/acse) is related to the Formal Languages and Compilers (FLC) course at Politecnico di Milano. It consists in developing the solutions of the past FLC **Laboratory** exams. For each listed past exam, there's a correctly working implementation associated with a detailed explanation. The GitHub repo is available [here](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/acse)

## Wireless Internet project (done)

This project was part of the evaluation for the Wireless Internet course at Politecnico di Milano during the academic year 2023-24. The GitHub repo is available [here](https://github.com/GianlucaVigo/Wireless-Internet-Project_MAC-Randomization)

**Project Description**
> Modern smartphones randomize their MAC address during probe request emission. You are requested to produce a dataset characterizing the MAC randomization of your own device, following what done in the following paper: “A dataset of labelled device Wi-Fi probe requests for MAC address de-randomiza6on” by L. Pintor and L. Aztori, Computer Networks, Vol. 205, March 2022. The project should output a set of .pcap files, containing probe requests emiXedfrom your smartphones in different condi6ons (screen on/off, Wi-Fi on/off, Power saving on/off) to characterize the randomization behaviour of your smartphone. A final report is required to describe your findings.
